FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Expose the port your app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]


## 3. Checking for Other Files

Looking through your codebase, I don't see any other files that directly connect to the database. The main connections are handled in:

1. `server.js` - Updated above
2. `test-db.js` - Updated above
3. `db-inspector.js` - Already updated with environment variables

## 4. Ensuring Dockerfile Handles Environment Variables

Your Dockerfile should be updated to properly handle environment variables:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Expose the port your app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
